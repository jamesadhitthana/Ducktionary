# Introduction

The Ducktionary is a dictionary application made in Java for PC. Dictionary applications that are on PC today don't really look that neat with outdated UI. Therefore to combat that,this dictionary application for PC has Material Design in mind. So that compatibility isnâ€™t an issue, the application is created with the Java programming language. Therefore this should work on most PCs since Java is usually installed in most PCs already. However, since we will be creating the dictionary app with Material design in mind, Java itself cannot handle the complexities of material design. This is why other than java, JavaFX and especially the JFoenix library which is an external library that allows the usage of material design in a Java application is used.
